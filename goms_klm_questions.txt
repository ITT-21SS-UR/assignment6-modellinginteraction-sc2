a) What does the term “critical path” describe with regard to GOMS?

The critical path in GOMS is derived from the critical path method from project
management. The critical path is used to display parallel activities and 
calculate total task times. Together with Cognition, Perception, Motor operators
and the critical path usage they form the CPM-GOMS.
Similiar to project management, the critical path in GOMS is the sequence of 
activities that determines the longest path through the chart and it shows an 
estimate of how much time in total is needed to perform the entire task.

b) Why might the original KLM not perfectly model input performance on a laptop?
   How could it be adapted?
